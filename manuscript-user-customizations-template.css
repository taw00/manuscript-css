/* CSS for Manuscript Formating v3.0
 *
 * manuscript-user-customizations.css - user-defined CSS overrides.
 *
 * Insert user-defined customizations below if you wish them to be
 * persistent. Maybe your favorite editor forces stylings that you can't deal
 * with, or maybe you want to make your own theme. Or maybe â€¦ you hate
 * Times New Roman. Etc etc.
 *
 * To use:
 * 1. Copy this file to manuscript-user-customizations.css.
 * 2. Edit.
 * 3. Enjoy with a tasty beverage.
 *
 * Disclaimer: CSS is tricky. Good luck. :)
