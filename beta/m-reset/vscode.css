/* CSS for Manuscript Formating v3.0
 *
 * m-reset/vscode.css - reset the VSCodium/VSCode (Visual Studio Code) app's
 * base styles to more friendly defaults for manuscript.css when attempting to
 * render from the application.
 * <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
 *
 * Markdown toolchains manipulate stylings. This attempts to reset those to
 * play nice with manuscript-css.
