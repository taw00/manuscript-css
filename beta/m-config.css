/* CSS for Manuscript Formating v3.0
 *
 * m-config-constants: baseline variable constants
 * m-config-defaults: everything variable set to their defaults
 * m-config-permutations: the defaults adjusted based on classes the user sets
 *                        for each: narrative/nonnarrative, short/long, etc.
 *
 * There are values in here that can be overridden, but others that really
 * should not be (they are calculated or usually inherit).
