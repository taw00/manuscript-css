# Release Notes

- 2025-10-26 - v5.0
    - class name refactor. We drop all the m- suffixes from the class names.
      class m-title became class title, for example. The same holds true for
      classes part, chapter, and scene and poem.
    - class title-page added to wrap all title page stuff: contact, count, and
      title.
    - class count replaced class m-facts
    - much improved title offsets (should be absolutely "correct).
    - class classic (switch) added to use courier or courier-like fonts instead
      of times new roman for narrative prose.
    - class no-simulation (switch) turns off simulated page breaks in novel
      and poetry view representations of the document.

- 2025-09-12
