/* "Normalized" stylings for this toolchain before we layer ours on top.
 *
 * Included are some normalization in the context of markdown applications that
 * can produce a finished rendered view from within their respective
 * interfaces. Noted here are Joplin and VSCode because they allow you to
 * import CSS and manipulate the rendered result. Conversely, many markdown
 * editors that give you the ability to generate a rendered view (GhostWriter
 * for example) but will disallow CSS overrides or will disallow anything more
 * than remedial CSS changes. For those you will have to do the true rendering
 * outside of those toolchains.
