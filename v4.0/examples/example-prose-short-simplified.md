<!--
Typical short story example w/ 'simple' flag set.
(less formal and more presentable to friends and family)

- title page stuff (but they get hidden)
- scenes
- uses the 'simple' article class. This signals the document to render without
  first-page headers, page breaks, or metadata and moves the title to the top of
  the first page.

<section class="m-scene">


This document is an example of a typical short story. It has no parts or
chapters, just scenes and the title page exists, but is rendered invisible by
the 'simple flag. I will create a formal version of my manuscript, then add the
'simple' flag in the classes for #manuscript, generate a PDF or HTML version
and share that with folks to review. When I am ready, I remove the simple flag
and create the manuscript.
