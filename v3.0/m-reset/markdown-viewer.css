/* CSS for Manuscript Formating v3.0
 *
 * m-reset/markdown-viewer.css - adjust the Markdown Viewer browser extension
 * so that it doesn't interfere (overly much) with our HTML and PDF renderings.
 * <https://github.com/simov/markdown-viewer>
 *
 * Markdown toolchains manipulate stylings. It's a constant battle to make them
 * play nice with manuscript-css.
