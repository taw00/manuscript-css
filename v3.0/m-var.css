/* CSS for Manuscript Formating v3.0
 *
 * m-var/constants: baseline variable constants
 * m-var/defaults:  everything variable set to their defaults
 * m-var/permutations: the defaults adjusted based on classes the user sets for
 *                     each: narrative/nonnarrative, short/long, etc.
 *
 * There are values in here that can be overridden, but others that really
 * should not be. Tread carefully.
