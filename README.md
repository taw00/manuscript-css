# Manuscript Formatting for Markdown for Writers

Are you a writer? Do you draft in markdown? And do you wish to share your work
in a professional manner without having to jump tools? Save LibreOffice or
Google Docs or whatever for submission time. Importing this `manuscript.css`
stylesheet plus leveraging a bit of HTML in your markdown document will
configure your work to render in and export to a generalized industry standard
manuscript format.

How to use: TL;DR - Check out the sample manuscripts in this repository.

> Just remember, when you submit to an editor, they will likely have very
> specific requirements for the format of your manuscript. The rule is: submit
> in whatever format they demand. This is not for that.

### Supported formatting:

1. A generalized manuscript format for prose.
2. US Letter- or A4-dimensioned artifacts.
3. Short-form (e.g. short stories) and long-form (novel, and book-sized) works.
4. Narrative and non-narrative prose.
5. A lot of customization if you know your CSS.

### What this does not support:

- Nuanced out-of-the-box customization.
- No 'Lastname / Short Title / Pagenumber' in the headers of page 2 and onward.
  Not yet anyway.
- There is a bug with page-breaking. The CSS is configured to disallow
  page-breaking in weird places, like between a chapter title and the prose, but
  those rules are ignored.

### My writer's workflow:
1. 0-draft is either in markdown or hand-written
2. Drafting leveraging the Joplin Application <https://joplinapp.org>  
   (_Joplin is a note-taking software applicaton that also serves as an
     excellent general purpose markdown editor._)
3. Periodic sharing of drafts and portion of a drafts with critique partners
   and alpha readers. For this, I also use Joplin's excellent Joplin Cloud
   service where all my work is backed up securely to the cloud and where I can
   selectively publish to the web a pretty, rendered version of my work.

This *should* work with just about any markdown editor out there. You may have
to do some custom CSS to ensure the renderer of your choice doesn't add in extra
stylings of its own. Since I overload the purpose of Joplin when I draft, I had
to create a set of CSS to squash all of its Joplinisms when I render the
document.

### Structure summary of a manuscript drafted in markdown

```markdown
<style>
    @import "manuscript-core.css";
</style>
<div id="vpage"><div id="manuscript">

<div id="m-contact">
... your name, address, email, cell, and date ...
</div>

<div class="m-header">
... title, subtitle, author ...
<div id="m-facts">
... wordcount, genre ...  
</div>
... an epigraph if you like ...
</div></div>

<!-- Note that there can be many scenes w/in a chapter, many chapters w/in a
     part, and many parts w/in a manuscript. Chapters & parts are optional.
     And, though titling and such are supported for scenes, it's something
     commonly done. Useful for embedded draft notes into a manuscript. -->

<section class="m-part">
<div class="m-header">
... part title, etc ...
</div>
<section class="m-chapter">
<div class="m-header">
... chapter title, etc ...
</div>
<section class="m-scene">
<div class="m-header">
... scene title, etc ...
</div>
... this scene's prose ...
</section>
<section class="m-scene">
<div class="m-header">
... scene title, etc ...
</div>
... this scene's prose ...
</section>

###### \#

<section class="m-scene">
... the next scene, etc ...
</section>
<section class="m-chapter">
... chapter 2 and its scenes, then chapter 3, etc ...
</section>
<section class="m-part">
... part 2 and its chapters, then part 3, etc ...
</section>

###### The End

</div></div>
<!-- the end of the manuscript -->
```

That top bit can be tweaked. For example, if I wanted to format the manuscript
as a long-form, non-narrative work destined to produce A4-dimensioned
artifacts, I would just have to edit a few things:

```markdown
<!-- the beginning of markdown file -->
<style>
    @import "manuscript.css";
    @page { size: A4 portrait; margin: 25.4mm; }
</style>
<div id="vpage"><div id="manuscript" class="A4 long non-narrative">
    ... your manuscript ...
```

### FONTS / TYPEFACES

The default fonts used by the manuscript are ones selected to conform to what
is expectedâ€”namely Times New Roman close equivalents, but also Arial and
Courier New, depending on need.

You really don't need to import new typefaces (your computer should know how to
handle a request for any one of those), but if you want to explore my open
source font recommendations, just add these imports to the top of your
manuscript:

```markdown
<style>
    @import "https://toddwarner.io/pub/css/m-font-serif-termes.css";
    @import "https://toddwarner.io/pub/css/m-font-serif-tinos.css";
    @import "https://toddwarner.io/pub/css/m-font-sans-arimo.css";
    @import "https://toddwarner.io/pub/css/m-font-mono-cousine.css";
</style>
```

Good luck and get back to writing.
