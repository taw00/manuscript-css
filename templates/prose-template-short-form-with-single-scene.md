This document is an example of a typical short story. It has no parts or
chapters, just scenes. Many of my super shorts (the 2000 word range and shorter)
have only one scene. Also notice the auto-inserted
[dinkuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus) between the scenes and the
[-30-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-30-) marker at `The End`.
