<!--
Convert this to PDF (reference README.md on how to do that).

This example:
- only scenes, not even contact info or facts or a title
- great for reviewing narrative snippets
- when writing a novel, I will often initially have it all organized as a
  different document per scene.

This document is an example of a story snippet. It has no parts or
chapters, just scenes. AND It doesn't even have the metadata info: no contact
info, nor facts.

Notice the auto-inserted
[dinkuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus) between the scenes. But I
changed the [-30-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-30-) marker from its default
of *The End* to *• • •*. I just felt that *The End* was a bit absolute for a
snippet.
