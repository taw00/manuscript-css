Convert this to PDF (reference README.md on how to do that).

This example:
- we are using parts (and chapters and scenes)
- we are using automated title generation for parts and chapters (but not
  scenes). We are using the default configuration where the titles will look
  like: Part 1, Chapter 3, etc.
- included examples of typeface imports that match the default fontstacks
  defined in _manuscript-config.css.

This document templates a narrative that is divided into parts, chapters, and
scenes. Most short stories are just a series of scenes. Most books-length
(long-form) manuscripts are divided into chapters and scenes. But some books
are also divided into books or parts. Of those divisions, only scenes are
required for this manuscript to template out correctly. But here, we demo all
the major bits.

_War and Peace_ by Leo Tolstoy, for example, is divided into 15 books with two 
epilogues and many many chapters. _At the Mountains of Madness_, a novella by
H.P. Lovecraft is a series of chapters with only one scene each. That novella is
included as an example in this repository.

Side note: the dotted lines in the HTML view are simulalated page breaks. They
can be turned off by setting the `--m-page-break-simulated-long` to `0`. If you
look in the `<style>...</style>` block above, I have that commented out.
Uncomment it to see the change. HTML doesn't "page break" so we put in an
indicator as an approximation of the behavior.

The only time I turn off the page break similation is when I am sharing the 
document as an HTML page. I.e., when the HTML becomes the primary end artifact.

I think you get the idea. I am ending this manuscript with this scene.

Also, did you notice the `#` [dinkuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus)
between the scenes? And the `The End` at the end? That's a typographical marker
called a [-30-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-30-). You can turned them off or
change them by redefining CSS variabbles `--m-dinkus` and `--m-30-`. For
example, set `--m-dinkus` to an empty string `""` to turn it off and set
`--m-30-` to "La Fin" just because you think your critique readers reviewers
will be impressed with your French.
