<section class="m-scene">


This document is an example of a story snippet. It has no parts or
chapters, just scenes. AND It doesn't even have the metadata info: no contact
info, nor facts.

Notice the auto-inserted
[dinkuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus) between the scenes. But I
changed the [-30-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-30-) marker from its default
of *The End* to *• • •*. I just felt that *The End* was a bit absolute for a
snippet.

This is a scene. This is a scene. This is a scene. This is a scene.
